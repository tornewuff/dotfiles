dotfiles
========

My dotfiles from $HOME. Comments and contributions welcomed.

I use [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) to symlink these files into $HOME.

If you are me, you can bootstrap this by installing
[myrepos](http://myrepos.branchable.com/) and running:

```
mr --trust-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tornewuff/dotfiles/master/mrconfig
```

If you aren't me, you shouldn't do this, as this runs commands!
