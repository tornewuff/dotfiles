dotfiles
========

My dotfiles from $HOME. Comments and contributions welcomed.

I use [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io/) to manage these files.

If you are me, you can bootstrap this with:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- -b "$HOME/.local/bin" init --apply tornewuff
```

If you aren't me, you shouldn't do this, probably?
